# phylogenies

This is a classroom assignment to practice phylogenetic reconstruction with
maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. The use of a Github repository for
assignments is experimental and optional. The purpose is to encourage students
to learn git, and to promote good practices in bioinformatics: making their
own work easily reproducible, easy to share, and well organized and documented.

The expected workflow is as follows.
* The student clones the master branch of this repository in their own computer.
* She works on it, following the instructions, and regularly commiting her advance.
* The student forks this repository to create a public one linked to it.
* She pushes her work to her remote repository, and sends me a pull request when ready.
* I will pull the changes to a local branch, and push them to the remote branch named after the student.

Unfortunately, the details of how all this is done are beyond the scope of the
course. There is plenty of documentation and tutorials on git and Github.
